BrainSuite QC System

Requirements:
    BrainSuite <http://brainsuite.org/>
    Nipype <http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/0.12.0/>
    Dataset must be provided in BIDS format. <http://bids.neuroimaging.io/>
    Must have volblend added to your path
        /ifs/faculty/shattuck/incoming
    Must have dfsrender added to your path
        /ifs/faculty/shattuck/incoming


NOTES:
Main changes to note for BIDS compliancy, when restructuring your dataset:
        Require participants.tsv on top level of dataset directory
        All data for a subject goes into subjID directory
            In each subject's directory, subfolders specify type of data (T1 weighted goes into anat directory)
            T1 weighted data is suffixed with _T1w, and is named after subjID, as per BIDS convention
                Example: The data for subject with subjID of sub-1003 is named: sub-1003_T1w.nii.gz


Support for multiple sessions not yet implemented
    For now, give multiple sessions of the same subject different subjIDs


public directory will look like this:
public
    index.html
    brainsuite_state.json
    thumbnails
        1003
            ...
        1004
            ...
